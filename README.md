# Final Project

I used Gatsby for this project (gatsby develop). I created a list of my favorite films in 2024 so far. I got the API key from OMDb API (https://www.omdbapi.com/). I also used the unique id (imdbID) for each film to create node in gatsby-node.js file. I added a comment form for users to comment about the films. I also added a search function following from the examples in class. For CI and github workflow, I added some tests. I did these steps: npm install jest, npm ci, npm test, npm run lint. Then I deployed my site to Netlify using a GitHub action. Then I did these steps: netlify login, netlify init, netlify link, netlify dev. Below are my links.
